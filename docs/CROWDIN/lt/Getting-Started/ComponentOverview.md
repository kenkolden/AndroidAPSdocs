# Component Overview

**AAPS** is not just a (self-built) application, it is but one of several modules of your closed loop system. Before deciding for components, it would be a good idea to have a look at the component documentation.

```{note}
**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE**

The foundation of **AAPS** safety features discussed in this documentation is built on the safety features of the hardware used to build your system. For closing an automated insulin dosing loop, it is critically important that you only use an insulin pump and CGM that are tested, fully functioning and approved by the official instances of your country. Šių komponentų aparatinės ar programinės įrangos pakeitimai gali sukelti netikėtą insulino tiekimą ir taip sukelti didelę riziką vartotojui. If you find or get offered broken, modified or self-made insulin pumps or CGM receivers, **do not use** these for creating an **AAPS** system.

Be to, ne mažiau svarbu naudoti tik originalius priedus, tokius kaip įšovikliai, kateteriai ir insulino rezervuarai, patvirtinti jūsų pompos ar CGM gamintojo. Nepatikrintų ar modifikuotų priedų naudojimas gali sukelti CGM sistemos netikslumus ir insulino tiekimo klaidas. Insulinas yra labai pavojingas, jei jis neteisingai dozuotas. Nežaisk su savo gyvenimu naudodamas neišbandytus ar modifikuotus priedus.

Last but not least, you must not take SGLT-2 inhibitors (gliflozins) as they incalculably lower blood sugar levels. Ypač pavojingas derinys su sistema, kuri sumažina bazę siekdama pakelti glikemiją, nes dėl gliflozinų šis glikemijos padidėjimas gali neįvykti ir gali grėsmingai pritrūkti insulino.

## Necessary Modules

### Good individual dosage algorithm for your diabetes therapy

Even though this is not something to create or buy, this is the 'module' which is probably underestimated the most but essential. When you let an algorithm help manage your diabetes, it needs to know the right settings to not make severe mistakes. Even if you are still missing other modules, you can already verify and adapt your **Profile** in collaboration with your diabetes team.

The **Profile** includes:

- BR (Basal rates): provides background insulin;
- ISF (insulin sensitivity factor): how much your blood glucose level will be reduced by 1 unit of insulin;
- CR (carb ratio): how many grams of carbohydrate are covered by one unit of insulin;
- DIA (duration of insulin action).

Most loopers use circadian BR, ISF and CR, which adapt hormonal insulin sensitivity during the day.

More information about your **Profile** [on the dedicated page](../SettingUpAaps/YourAapsProfile.md).

### Phone

See the dedicated page [Phones](../Getting-Started/Phones.md).

### Insulin pump

See the dedicated page [Compatible Pumps](../Getting-Started/CompatiblePumps.md).

**Advantages and disadvantages of some pump models**

The Combo, the Insight and the older Medtronic are solid pumps, and loopable. The Combo has the advantage of many more infusion set types to choose from as it has a standard Luer-Lock. And the battery is a default one you can buy at any gas station, 24-hour convenience store and if you really need one, you can steal/borrow it from the remote control in the hotel room ;-).

The advantages of the DanaR/RS and Dana-i vs. the Combo as the pump of choice however are:

- The Dana pumps connect to almost any phone with Android >= 5.1 without the need to flash lineage. If your phone breaks you usually can find easily any phone that works with the Dana pumps as quick replacement... not so easy with the Combo. (This might change in the future when Android 8.1 gets more popular)
- Initial pairing is simpler with the Dana-i/RS. But you usually only do this once so it only impacts if you want to test a new feature with different pumps.
- So far the Combo works with screen parsing. In general that works great but it is slow. For looping this does not matter much as everything works in the background. Still there is much more time you need to be connected so more time when the BT connection might break, which isn't so easy if you walk away from your phone whilst bolusing & cooking.
- The Combo vibrates on the end of TBRs, the DanaR vibrates (or beeps) on SMB. At nighttime, you are likely to be using TBRs more than SMB.  The Dana-i/RS is configurable so that it does neither beep nor vibrate.
- Reading the history on the Dana-i/RS in a few seconds with carbs makes it possible to switch phones easily while offline and continue looping as soon a soon as some CGM values are in.
- All pumps **AAPS** can talk with are waterproof on delivery. Only the Dana pumps are also "waterproof by warranty" due to the sealed battery compartment and reservoir filling system.

### Glikemijos šaltinis

See the dedicated page [Compatible CGMs](../Getting-Started/CompatiblesCgms.md).

### **AAPS**-.apk file

The main component of the system. In order to install the app, you have to build the apk-file yourself first. Instructions are [here](../SettingUpAaps/BuildingAaps.md).

### Reporting server

A reporting server displays your glucose and treatment data, and creates reports for detailed analysis. There are currently two reporting servers available for use with AAPS : [Nightscout](../SettingUpAaps/SettingUpTheReportingServer.md#nightscout) and [Tidepool](../SettingUpAaps/SettingUpTheReportingServer.md#tidepool). They both provide ways to visualize your diabetes data over time, provide statistics about the **time in range** (TIR) and other measures.

The Reporting server is independent of the other modules. If you don’t want to use a reporting server, you should know that it is not mandatory for running **AAPS** in the long term. But you still need to set up one as it will be required to fulfill [**Objective 1**](../SettingUpAaps/CompletingTheObjectives.md#objective-1-setting-up-visualization-and-monitoring-analyzing-basals-and-ratios).

Additional information on how to set up your reporting server can be found [here](../SettingUpAaps/SettingUpTheReportingServer.md).

## Optional Modules

### Smartwatch

You can choose any smartwatch with Android WearOS 1.x up to 4.x. **Beware, WearOS 5.x is not compatible!**

The Sony Smartwatch 3 (SWR50) is commonly used amongst loopers as it is the only watch that can get readings from Dexcom G6/G5 when phone is out of range. Some other watches can be patched to work as a standalone receiver as well (see [this documentation](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/wiki/Patching-Android-Wear-devices-for-use-with-the-G5) for more details).

Users are creating a [list of tested phones and watches](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?usp=sharing). There are different watchfaces for use with **AAPS**, which you can find [here](../UsefulLinks/WearOsSmartwatch.md).

To record a phone or watch that isn't already listed in the spreadsheet then please fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvmuqLTZ7MizuFBoTyVCZXuDb__jnQawEvMYtnnT9RGY6QUw/viewform).

Any problems with the spreadsheet please email [hardware@androidaps.org](mailto:hardware@androidaps.org), any donations of phone/watch models that still need testing please email [donations@androidaps.org](mailto:donations@androidaps.org).

### xDrip+

Even if you don't need to have the [xDrip+ App](https://xdrip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as **BG Source**, you can still use it for _i.e._ alarms or a different blood glucose display. You can have as many alarms as you want, specify the time when the alarm should be active, if it can override silent mode, etc. Some xDrip+ information can be found [here](../CompatibleCgms/xDrip.md). Please be aware that the documentations to this app are not always up to date as its progress is quite fast.

## What to do while waiting for modules

It sometimes takes a while to get all the modules for closing the loop. But no worries, there are a lot of things you can do while waiting. It is **necessary** to check and (where appropriate) adapt basal rates (BR), insulin-carbratio (IC), insulin-sensitivity-factors (ISF) etc. And maybe open loop can be a good way to test the system and get familiar with **AAPS**. Using this mode, **AAPS** gives treatment recommendations you can manually execute.

You can keep on reading through the docs here, get in touch with other loopers online or offline, [read](../Where-To-Go-For-Help/Background-reading.md) documentations or what other loopers write (even if you have to be careful, not everything is correct or good for you to reproduce).

**Done?** If you have your **AAPS** components all together (congrats!) or at least enough to start in open loop mode, you should first read through the [Objective description](../SettingUpAaps/CompletingTheObjectives.md) before each new Objective and setup up your hardware.
